# Flow Engine ðŸš¦
A simple flow engine that executes a flow consisting of several linked rules, in this case against some incoming data (*a JSON string that can be parsed to a JavaScript object literal*).

**Task runner and some fancy NPM packages used in this project:**

* Gulp - https://gulpjs.com
* Gulp connect - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-connect

**How to use:**

To install the required dependencies, from the terminal: 
```
npm install
```
Start Gulp:

```
gulp
```
you will be able to listen the server on http://localhost:8080

Go with the flow! ðŸ¤˜
